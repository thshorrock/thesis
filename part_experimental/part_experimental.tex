In \partref{theory} it was shown, with a computational model,
that a low frequency wave can alter the response of a bubble to a higher frequency pulse.
The lower frequency wave, the cavitating wave,
pulsates the bubble and induces transitory changes in its response to a higher frequency, imaging pulse.

This model is tested experimentally in this part of the thesis.
\Chapref{rationale} introduces the methodology of the experiment.
\Chapref{water_cavitation}
then describes the experiments performed on %three different bubble models: 
bubbles induced from the Type III and Type IV nucleation  of water.
%commercial microbubbles (\Sonovue),
%and bubbles generated by Type I\todo{check this type} cavitatioin of perfluoropentane.
